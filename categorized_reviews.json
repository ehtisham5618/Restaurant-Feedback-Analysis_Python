I want to say again the SERVICE is great! The manager with the blonde hair came by and checked in, the people are friendly … Drinks were on point too. Just be aware that there are flies and the inside doesn't give $2,000 pizza vibes. If you sit outside everything will be fine.",

Ugh, I should have stuck with pizza. Unfortunately it was absolutely inedible and the manager of such a big and popular restaurant should be embarrassed to serve such unappetizing slop to valued customers. It was powdery, watery yellow slop with about a tablespoon of vegetables inside. I picked out the filling, ate the salad and shared my son’s pizza. I should have said something but I didn’t. I feel bad that I wasted over $20 for that crap, and left hungry. That “omelette” should be taken off the menu until the chef actually figures out how to prepare a vegan omelette. May I suggest a tofu scramble or chickpea flour omelette instead? There are a lot of good recipes out there for them. And actually make sure it’s edible before insulting good-paying customers with slop.",

I made a simple request to make my pizza half margarita and half another kind on the menu. Every pizza place I’ve been to is able to do this, but the chef refused. “We can’t do that” they said. Why not if that’s what the customer wants? So I had to change my request and ask for ricotta cheese as a topping on my margarita. I got about a teaspoon of ricotta per slice, so skimpy, and was charged extra for that. In terms of comfort, it got very chilly when the sun went down, and there were no heat lamps. I was so cold I couldn’t wait to get the check and leave. I understand this place is more expensive because of the ambiance of sitting near the water and it is NYC, but all my son and I ordered were two personal pizzas, and a glass of mocktail punch for him (I drank water), and the bill was $77. A bit outrageous, especially since I was uncomfortably cold and couldn’t get what I wanted. We go occasionally because it’s a great view of the harbor and the food tastes good, but there is definitely room for improvement. The chef needs to be less rigid and stingy, and they should invest in some heat lamps to make customers more comfortable while enjoying the view, or at least leave their igloos up until the end of May.",

We were told four things that we tried to order were out of stock and then spied someone at a nearby table who arrived after us eating one of them. We would have indulged in 3-4 cocktails each but my husband canceled his second drink after 40 minutes and not being able to attract any attention. The main course was piled on top of the appetizer plates. We could not track anyone down to provide more water. The lemondate my girls ordered was all ice. I could go on for hours. If the garage we parked in had been open later I would have hunted down a manager but given that we were trying to have a festive day downtown (we live on the UES) and the insane disappointment and disgust with our meals and service, the only thing I wanted to do was leave. I will not apologize for this being harsh. We eat out 4 nights a week ranging from Michelin star to local establishments, and this was just a regret.",

We were told that there was a limit of 250 plates, which was never stated in their website or flyers that were posted online and in person.

The waiter returned 5 minutes later and told 2 individuals that they had ran out of baked potatoes and given the option of substituting with french fries (truffle fries). This was very disappointing. I gave the waiter the idea of adding mashed potatoes to the dish instead of french fries with the steak, which they were finally able to do.

The lemonade was undrinkable; tasted more like the mix used for whiskey sours. Did not drink. Our waiter was unavailable so we didn't request it be taken off the bill. The Hunter omelet was perfect and delicious. Service, however, was extremely rushed-constantly coming by to remove a plate, even while one person was still eating.

I had the Lobster Cobb Salad, which was delicious, however, at $30 for a salad, I would expect a good portion of lump lobster meat as if it came from a good-sized lobster tail. Instead, I received tiny pieces of lobster meat scattered on the salad. Very disappointing. I asked the waitress to recommend a draft beer because I'm a Heineken drinker and it wasn't an option, so she pointed out the first draft beer listed and I don't recall the name. It was delicious, went perfectly with my salad, and was unlike the bite of Heineken. As the meal progressed, the music volume was vastly elevated making a conversation a bit challenging. Overall, this is an excellent spot for meeting up with friends.",

I've dined here twice before and will return for all these reasons, not to mention that its a great place for photos.",

We got a mini house outside and today was perfect for it not being cold. The food came out very quickly and all dishes were perfect. Honeybee pizza is for anyone who doesn't want the Diablo which is spicy. I had mini lamb chop lollipops, lobster taco and greek salad with shrimp. Definitely try this for large groups or a cute date in the mini house.",

Chocolate mousse was served in four tiny chocolate 'cups', and each had whipped cream--they were also sitting in a very small amount of whipped cream (which kind of melted and therefore didn't look intentional but more like they were trying to cover up a spill. It was a nice idea, but for me there was way too much whipped cream and not enough mousse at all. Also, when I ordered a latte, it came in a glass cup, and the coffee seemed very weak. We liked our server a lot, but he never was around. I always had to ask someone else to tell him we wanted to order, or we were ready for the dessert menu, or the check, etc. (btw, the place was only half full) When we left, we had to actually interrupt a group of servers (who were just standing around talking) just to get out of the restaurant. There was a very odd element to this place. A professional photographer was roaming around the place asking to take pictures of the customers. One family with small children next to us agreed. But I didn't really like the intrusion on our lunch. The place itself is so gorgeous. So beautiful, and the view of the water is great. The only big problem is that you have to endure the smell of diesel from the boats, which is a big deterrent. All in all, it's not a terrible place, but it's not great either.",

We ordered the truffle potato twists as an appetizer which came out cold. The margarita pizza barely had any cheese on it (for the style of a margarita). They messed up another pizza (added sausage to it when we didn’t order it) and ultimately had to pay for another pizza to replace it. Server was not attentive at all. It was downright annoying… we had to literally wave our hands and flag him down several times for soda refills for our kids even though the place was not crowded. No ranch dressing at all for pizza, small thing but really no ranch dressing in the entire restaurant??? Food was prepared fast, which was a plus. Nice location and very nice holiday decorations but as far as ambience, the loud music was out of balance relative to the amount of people in the restaurant which in my opinion killed the ambiance. Overall, didn’t get the value for the money spent and can’t say I recommend this place.",

The food, on the other hand, was absolutely atrocious. I booked a table for 10 people. At least 5 of the 10 sent the food back. The \"Chef\" is unskilled and under qualified. We ordered pancakes. An extremely basic dish to make. The pancakes we were served were obviously pre-packaged and microwaved. Foul beyond belief! The eggs were supposed to be over-easy. They were all cooked hard. The potato curls had obviously come out of the freezer and been reheated - awful texture, equally awful flavour, dry and unappetizing. To say that I was extremely disappointed would be a gross understatement. I would certainly not recommend ANYONE to this restaurant. If you want to eat while enjoying the views I would suggest you either buy from any other of the many restaurants in the area or you pack a picnic from home and enjoy that. Do not waste your time and money here.",

Some friends and I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. When we entered the receptionist checked us in and wished my wife a happy birthday and that was it. No further recognition. We were seated outside at a table for four. The noise level, particularly the blaring music made it almost impossible to hear each other. While waiting for one of our guests to arrive, two of us ordered iced tea. A little while later the waiter returned to tell us the iced tea 'machine' was broken. We ordered a number of small plates. Three of us tried the mussels but they literally were inedible. The waiter was told about it but did nothing. Among the other plates the ahi tuna nachos were notable for their almost total lack of tuna. What was included were literally pea size pieces of tuna surrounded by lots of cabbage, avocado, etc. The crab cake, the margarita pizza and the bianca pizza were just okay but nothing special. The wines and the tequila cocktail were fine. But everything was so disappointing that our friends insisted on going elsewhere for dessert and to celebrate the birthday.",

I have learned that the service staff is always friendly but I do tend to need to ask for things such as water or refills on cocktails. But the staff is always friendly. Caleb was super kind and friendly as well as patient. I enjoyed him. The thing that disturbed me this time was seeing the bus boys wearing gloves and touching dirty dishes, then touching my clean water bottle by the opening of the bottle. I have no idea how often the bus boys swap their gloves, but I have a feeling they don’t realize how yucky the gloves are when they are touching clean plates, bottles of water and water glasses. I would prefer to see them not wearing gloves and washing their hands more often. If they were not wearing gloves they would realize how nasty their hands are and I have a feeling would wash their hands more often, in turn keeping the guests plate-ware/ glasses/ silverware more sanitary.",

The food was good and plentiful (although, I do wish there was a turkey burger on the menu!) we were comfortable and the setting just lovely. But I will NEVER forget the kindness of your staff and that waiter. Of course, we gave him a tip that was twice the cost of our meal. Well deserved !!! Doesn't happen all that much!!

There was a tiny service glitch at the beginning, and we had three servers introduce themselves as our server until we had one that stuck around. He was very good, so it wasn’t a massive big deal. We waited for nothing. Great food and ambience",

And that's just the beginning of a lovely meal that includes wood oven pizza, fresh salad, and inventive small plates all served in front of a fantastic view. I love the pinwheel sausage and the hot honey pizza, but just about anything goes with that yummy frozen Aperol spritz.",
