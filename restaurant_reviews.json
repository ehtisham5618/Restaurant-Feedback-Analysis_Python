The pizza is great and my go to small plate is the lamb Meatballs.    But everything we have eaten there has been great.  \n   I also like that there no surcharge for using a credit card as so many places do now.   I hate that and feel that if you need the money raise your price.   Many places add the surcharge so the cover the card fee or get cash the they may or may not report."

We ordered apps, pizza and Kale salad which came quickly. For some reason the acoustics are bad and you have to shout to talk even though the music didn\u2019t seem to be too loud. Regardless I do recommend this restaurant."

We dined on the patio right in front of the entrance and witnessed the rats roam freely and chase each other accross the walkway!! It was so bad it became comical at some point. The restaurant staff seemed to be used to it and barely did anything. I completely understand that NYC has a rat issue but I never witnessed anything even close to seeing so many in the open while dining."

For a restaurant that has a $2,000 pizza the indoor portion of things was a little bit left to be desired. We were seated by I guess a large item that may be outdoors sometimes that is covered by clothes. There are FLIES alot of FLIES one literally died mid air during our meal and landed on the table. \n\nI want to say again the SERVICE is great! The manager with the blonde hair came by and checked in, the people are friendly \u2026 Drinks were on point too.  Just be aware that there are flies and the inside doesn't give $2,000 pizza vibes.  If you sit outside everything will be fine."

The waitress was too pushy and hovered over to see the tip amount and showed visible dismay at the 15% tip on the credit card. She asked my guess if they thought the service was good to pressure me into a larger tip. The funny thing about this is that I always intended to give her 20% but I can\u2019t put 20% on the company card so I leave additional money to cover the 20% tip (which I did). Just not an appropriate place to have serious client meetings or even basic busines lunches."

I have a 16 year old daughter and did not allow her to go to the bathroom here. I did NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE and neither did my young daughter. Even the man entering after me said WTF! I am disgusted and will NEVER return to this restaurant. I\u2019m NOT homophobic so don\u2019t you dare go there. As a parent, my daughter deserves to feel safe.

Order came out slowly, tea came at the end of the meal. But the worst was that our waiter came to our table at the end asking for payment and refused to show us the bill until we paid. We had to pay first in order to check our bill for mistakes. We found this unreasonable and very unprofessional."

            "Review": "The pizza that two of us had was delicious as always. But I was excited to try the vegan omelette and happy to see a new plant-based choice on the menu. Ugh, I should have stuck with pizza. Unfortunately it was absolutely inedible and the manager of such a big and popular restaurant should be embarrassed to serve such unappetizing slop to valued customers. It was powdery, watery yellow slop with about a tablespoon of vegetables inside. I picked out the filling, ate the salad and shared my son\u2019s pizza. I should have said something but I didn\u2019t. I feel bad that I wasted over $20 for that crap, and left hungry. \n\nThat \u201comelette\u201d should be taken off the menu until the chef actually figures out how to prepare a vegan omelette. May I suggest a tofu scramble or chickpea flour omelette instead? There are a lot of good recipes out there for them. And actually make sure it\u2019s edible before insulting good-paying customers with slop."

Our server Sam was on top of things.  The food was tasty. There was even a celebratory dessert given to our retiree.\nIf I had anything to complain about it would be that my food wasn't hot when I received it. I had the meatballs and potato wedges and they were both luke warm.  I didn't complain because they all tasted good,  but I would have preferred them to be a little warmer. Otherwise,  we had a very enjoyable experience."

            "Review": "We have been to Industry Kitchen many times and we like the food and location. But there were a few things that annoyed me last night. I made a simple request to make my pizza half margarita and half another kind on the menu. Every pizza place I\u2019ve been to is able to do this, but the chef refused. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that\u201d they said. Why not if that\u2019s what the customer wants? So I had to change my request and ask for ricotta cheese as a topping on my margarita. I got about a teaspoon of ricotta per slice, so skimpy, and was charged extra for that. \n\nIn terms of comfort, it got very chilly when the sun went down, and there were no heat lamps. I was so cold I couldn\u2019t wait to get the check and leave. \n\nI understand this place is more expensive because of the ambiance of sitting near the water and it is NYC, but all my son and I ordered were two personal pizzas, and a glass of mocktail punch for him (I drank water), and the bill was $77. A bit outrageous, especially since I was uncomfortably cold and couldn\u2019t get what I wanted. \n\nWe go occasionally because it\u2019s a great view of the harbor and the food tastes good, but there is definitely room for improvement. The chef needs to be less rigid and stingy, and they should invest in some heat lamps to make customers more comfortable while enjoying the view, or at least leave their igloos up until the end of May."

            "Review": "This was a last minute reservation we booked maybe 2 hours before going. One of us had gone already but it was first time for the rest of us. They accommodated us even though we were late to our original reservation so we were happy about that. The igloos are such good vibe if you\u2019re with friends, yes they will be going towards the warmer weather but for now if you can get one they are great. Ryan our server was excellent !!! He was so incredibly patient explaining everything to us and reassured me about a dish I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like but I ended up loving it. He was also super friendly and funny and checked in on us without being too much at the table.\nThe food was also excellent, everything presentation, taste was worth the money. We loved everything we had and the dessert tower was a great ending for any reservations that are a large group or multiple people.\nDefinitely will be back for sure ! If you go ask for Ryan !!"

We sat outside in one of the cute huts (heated and so comfortable) with a beautiful view of the Hudson River. \n\nWe ordered the grilled Atlantic salmon and the fattoush salad with salmon. My cousin and I ended up swapping our meals in the middle and suffice it to say, we both thoroughly enjoyed both entrees. My salmon was cooked to perfection (I like it rare). \n\nI also ordered a Downeast Cider which was delish!\n\nI was greeted by Ishaeb when I arrived who was so chill and welcoming. Ditto re: Salesta too. Our server Merlin was outstanding - attentive, efficient and friendly.\nKudos to the hiring manager!\n\nI highly recommend Industry Kitchen. The food was delicious, the ambiance was perfect and the service was fantastic. The staff really epitomize what exemplary customer service is all about!"

Straw was too short for the glass it was served in and I was charged for a refill.\nStaff were very pleasant. It can be loud later in the evening, but I went early enough that the noise level was low.\nThe gnocchi was delicious!"

We had everything from salalds, to eggs, to waffles & pancakes & pizza and there were no complaints-just empty plates.  Our server was on point, and  everything was easy.  Highly recommend others to visit and I can't wait to return!"

            "Review": "It is very rare that I write a review as my family is heavily involved in the metro area restaurant business and I understand all of the challenges that restaurants are faced with  however this experience left me feeling remorse for the $200 spent that I would have preferred to donate.  We were told four things that we tried to order were out of stock and then spied someone at a nearby table who arrived after us eating one of them.  We would have indulged in 3-4 cocktails each but my husband canceled his second drink after 40 minutes and not being able to attract any attention.  The main course was piled on top of the appetizer plates.  We could not track anyone down to provide more water.  The lemondate my girls ordered was all ice.  I could go on for hours.  If the garage we parked in had been open later I would have hunted down a manager but given that we were trying to have a festive day downtown (we live on the UES) and the insane disappointment and disgust with our meals and service, the only thing I wanted to do was leave.  I will not apologize for this being harsh.  We eat out 4 nights a week ranging from Michelin star to local establishments, and this was just a regret."

            "Review": "Visited Industry Kitchen on 11/23/23 for Thanksgiving dinner. Reservation was at 7pm and we had all traveled from Los Angeles in hopes of being near the water and having a great dinner. Unfortunately, when we arrived we were sat down and then told that there was no longer any Thanksgiving dinner options or plates. We were told that there was a limit of 250 plates, which was never stated in their website or flyers that were posted online and in person. The waiter told us they ran out of everything, including turkey and mashed potatoes. We were inclined to order from the regular menu. Some individuals in our group ordered steak with a baked potato. The waiter returned 5 minutes later and told 2 individuals that they had ran out of baked potatoes and given the option of substituting with french fries (truffle fries). This was very disappointing. I gave the waiter the idea of adding mashed potatoes to the dish instead of french fries with the steak, which they were finally able to do. Overall very disappointing and overcharged for the small portions of food."

Of course the atmosphere is beautiful, with the enclosed clear outdoor table and incredible waterside view, but the service was what made it amazing. I made the reservation on OpenTable and just clicked the birthday special occasion, but didn\u2019t add any notes or special requests. Upon arriving the hotesses greeted my husband with Happy Birthday and they gave us an incredible table of our choice. Our server, Eddie was so attentive and intentional and always checked to make sure we had everything we needed. The manager even stopped by to check on us too! We will absolutely be back and will be telling all of our friends about this gem!"

I hope they get double the pay!\n\nWe had a wonderful view of the pier! The food was absolutely delicious! Being from the South, we thought everything in NY restaurants was overpriced. We had the delicious Northern Italian soup, the grilled salmon with the vegetables, and the burrata was delish! Our server was a little confused or overwhelmed- not sure, but he was not efficient. A female server came to our rescue, apologized and took our order. She had a great attitude and cheerful disposition. If we're back in NY again, this  will be a deliciously reliable place."

We were the second party entering the restaurant so plenty of tables available. However, the new waiter got confused when we requested a different table so we didn't push it.    The lemonade was undrinkable; tasted more like the mix used for whiskey sours.  Did not drink.  Our waiter was unavailable\nso we didn't request it be taken off the bill.  The Hunter omelet was perfect and delicious.  Service, however, was extremely rushed-constantly coming by to remove a plate, even while one person was still eating.  \nWill give Industry Kitchen a second try."

I was charged ahead of time which isn't a problem but for a lunch meeting the dollar amount of $80 per person is excessive.  I don't mind paying for what we order but people weren't drinking and to spend $80 for a meal is too high.  I feel $50 would be sufficient and still on the high side.  There was over $200 that I paid that was for nothing.  People took food to go and we ordered apps and meals and still didn't meet the required amount.

The service service was good. I enjoyed the white sangria but after tasting my friends Schofferhofer grapefruit beer i switched to that. It was so light and fresh. For appetizers we shared the Spanish octopus and Fattoush salad. We both enjoyed the Fattoush salad more. For dinner my friend enjoyed the Pan  Roasted chicken breast and I enjoyed a New York strip steak which came with a double baked potato and asparagus."

She was busy with that and I understand, however, the whole service was rushed. When it was finally time for us to pay for our meal, she was nowhere to be found. When we were ready for her to take the payment, we saw that she was busy with the event, but she would walk by our table, avoided eye contact and act like she didn\u2019t see us waiting for her. It was to the point where we had to signal other waiters. I had to get up from my seat to look for other waiters and ask them to give us our checks and to take it when we were ready. The waiters had to look for her for us twice. Like I said, I understand that she had a lot on her plate, but they could\u2019ve at least assigned our table another waiter/waitress. It was just terrible service overall. Never experienced something like that before honestly; so disappointing."

Even their vegan pizza options are great. Watermelon arugula salad with salmon is bomb. Drinks are always on point and the view sets this spot apart from other indoor/outdoor spots. The only thing I\u2019d say could use just a bit of improvement is the brunch menu. Most items could use a bit more pizazz in flavor. But that\u2019s literally the only thing and it\u2019s not a big deal honestly. Oh and ask to be seated in Eman\u2019s section. Eman is the absolute best! Make your reservation today. You\u2019ll love it!"

I had the Lobster Cobb Salad, which was delicious, however, at $30 for a salad, I would expect a good portion of lump lobster meat as if it came from a good-sized lobster tail. Instead, I received tiny pieces of lobster meat scattered on the salad. Very disappointing. I asked the waitress to recommend a draft beer because I'm a Heineken drinker and it wasn't an option, so she pointed out the first draft beer listed and I don't recall the name. It was delicious, went perfectly with my salad, and was unlike the bite of Heineken. As the meal progressed, the music volume was vastly elevated making a conversation a bit challenging. Overall, this is an excellent spot for meeting up with friends."

There were a lot of empty better tables : when I asked to move was told they were all booked even though I had a reservation booked in advance and our only option was a table inside in front of the kitchen/ pass. The food and service was good but I was disappointed that I was put at a bad table when there were so many others available. It\u2019s a nice location with water views so being inside in front of the kitchen on a sunny day was a bummer . In spite of being busy the food was good and came quickly ."

Decided to come here on a whim and got a reservation for brunch that same afternoon, service was fantastic even though they were quite busy. The atmosphere near the water is lovely, although on a particularly hot day I would recommend sitting inside. They had most of the slide away walls open so you will still get fresh air and beautiful views, but benefit from the AC. \n\nDefinitely recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes! They were fantastic, and the portion was perfect. My boyfriend loved the lobster omelet too. Would come again!"

Asked nicely for a new table but every time one opened up there was a reason we couldn\u2019t sit there.  The manager explained to us what a reservation meant twice like we didn\u2019t understand but then also told us they had to hold tables for people who did make reservations (which we did).  Felt like he wanted to push us to the back and out of the way because we had kids.  My husband works a couple blocks away and we are always in the neighborhood but will never go back because of all the excuses and bs."

The food was well prepared and plated with sizable portions and well-priced in an overpriced NYC restaurant market.  Service was caring without being oversolicitous.  It was a Thursday night and they never rushed us even after the 90 minute limit they claim one has to abide by.  I've dined here twice before and will return for all these reasons, not to mention that its a great place for photos."

Then the food arrived all at once, starters and main together for some of us and not all - there were 5 of us. The waiter didn\u2019t really reappear until it was time to pay the bill which we waited for 30 minutes to do. Overall, food doesn\u2019t merit the price and crappy service."

We got a mini house outside and today was perfect for it not being cold. The food came out very quickly and all dishes were perfect. Honeybee pizza is for anyone who doesn't want the Diablo which is spicy. I had mini lamb chop lollipops, lobster taco and greek salad with shrimp. Definitely try this for large groups or a cute date in the mini house."

Prices are reasonable example, 4 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2entire and 2 dessert came up to $210 added a tip $250/270. Definitely recommend this place and will be going back. FYI if you go on Sunday brunch stops at 4pm then dinner menu starts at 5pm so in between those times you can order drinks, appetizers and pizza but I wouldn\u2019t miss the dinner food was that good"

Meatballs were excellent until I bit into one and felt a hard block, looked like a pit of some sort. Crab cake was definitely microwaved, but the aioli had a great flavor. Drinks were okay. The cosmopolitan I ordered had proseco in it, I\u2019m not sure why, and the second round I could taste espresso in the glass so they served it in a dirty glass with espresso still in it from their espresso cocktail that can be found on the menu. My husband had the Ceaser salad, which was great. I had the lobster omelette which lacked flavor and was luke warm. Ambiance is beautiful. Really lovely view. We would try it again."

            "Review": "Food was just okay. But the Beurremont Burrata was exceptional. Chocolate mousse was served in four tiny chocolate 'cups', and each had whipped cream--they were also sitting in a very small amount of whipped cream (which kind of melted and therefore didn't look intentional but more like they were trying to cover up a spill. It was a nice idea, but for me there was way too much whipped cream and not enough mousse at all. Also, when I ordered a latte, it came in a glass cup, and the coffee seemed very weak.\n\nWe liked our server a lot, but he never was around. I always had to ask someone else to tell him we wanted to order, or we were ready for the dessert menu, or the check, etc. (btw, the place was only half full) When we left, we had to actually interrupt a group of servers (who were just standing around talking) just to get out of the restaurant. \n\nThere was a very odd element to this place. A professional photographer was roaming around the place asking to take pictures of the customers. One family with small children next to us agreed. But I didn't really like the intrusion on our lunch.\n\nThe place itself is so gorgeous. So beautiful, and the view of the water is great. The only big problem is that you have to endure the smell of diesel from the boats, which is a big deterrent. \n\nAll in all, it's not a terrible place, but it's not great either."

The waitress was annoyed after receiving the tipping, she wanted more even though she hadn\u2019t served us the dinner. We thought that tipping was appropriate, never mind. Last but not least she described us as unpolite.. I\u2019m sorry if the tipping has not been as high as she wished, but the cordiality towords clients wins, always."

            "Review": "First night in New York and thought we would try this place as it was close to our hotel. Overall, it was just poor to ok. We ordered the truffle potato twists as an appetizer which came out cold. The margarita pizza barely had any cheese on it (for the style of a margarita). They messed up another pizza (added sausage to it when we didn\u2019t order it) and ultimately had to pay for another pizza to replace it. Server was not attentive at all. It was downright annoying\u2026 we had to literally wave our hands and flag him down several times for soda refills for our kids even though the place was not crowded. No ranch dressing at all for pizza, small thing but really no ranch dressing in the entire restaurant??? Food was prepared fast, which was a plus. Nice location and very nice holiday decorations but as far as ambience, the loud music was out of balance relative to the amount of people in the restaurant which in my opinion killed the ambiance. Overall, didn\u2019t get the value for the money spent and can\u2019t say I recommend this place."

The only thing I would change is for them to have some sort of shade available to prevent direct sunlight.  It was uncomfortable for our guests as they stared directly into the sun.  The bathroom situation was a bit odd since both bathrooms were unisex.  I can understand why they did it, it was just a weird feeling seeing men when I entered the bathroom.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend and we\u2019d dine there again."

Our last outing in New York before heading to the airport, grabbed some friends and an igloo table outside and had such an amazing time here. Beautiful views! Amazing food. The bao buns are insane, the potato curds cured my hangover <3 - Drinks amazing and service outstanding. Ryan deserves an entire review to himself - he was the best server we've had in New York. So genuine, kind, and really tied our overall experience together in a bow. Cannot recommend this place enough! xoxo, hayley + friends"

She said there wasn\u2019t availability around 2pm so we made a reservation (that was available on Open Table along with many other time slots) for 2:15 and told her we\u2019d be back in 15 \u2026. she went on to tell us that we still wouldn\u2019t be able to sit then because there were other reservations before us? Made no sense, because the place was far from full and why would the reservation be available if it wasn\u2019t\u2026 available? After a way too long argument which ended in her saying a dismissive \u201cokay\u201d and me giving up, we came back 15 mins later at 2:15 and were seated immediately and had a great experience. Would have been a 5 star review if not for this awful hostess."

What\u2019s er the sauce was ( I didn\u2019t lol back to check) was amazing.\no had an espresso martini that was yummy but a smaller than I usually get at similar restaurants. Although it was not packed I did feel a little rushed and was confused since they\u2019re just opened for lunch and weren\u2019t even there for an 1 and half. But our waitress was knowledgeable and gave some good suggestions.\nI\u2019d go back if ever in the are again but wouldn\u2019t seek it out."

However, on request, we were readily reseated in an outside cabin, as far from the nearest loudspeaker as possible and with a clear river view. A thumbs up for good customer service. Friendly and attentive service throughout after that, too. Vegetarian members of our party spoke well of their pizzas. Carnivores were satisfied with their steaks and chops\u2014decent value for Lower Manhattan waterfront dining."

It was the worst bread basket I\u2019ve ever had (stale, and taste like it was picked up from the corner store) I shared it was stale and I think I got the same bread, just toasted\u2026and it was $9.  The one cheap thing restaurants can do well is bread. The kale salad looked good but was missing something.  The patio is amazing, but you can get the view for free."

The hostess was very accommodating when we arrived early for our reservation. The server and bus person were quick to take our orders and bring drinks. They didn\u2019t have a great wine selection, but the food was very flavorful. We order salmon and the baked chicken. We also ordered an hummus and ricotta appetizer. It was delicious!"

I went on a Saturday afternoon and had what I call The Blue Meal - Blueberry Froz\u00e9, Maryland Blue Crab Cake plate and Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with blueberries and strawberries. Exquisite! At my server Ish\u2019s recommendation, the meal was just the balance I wanted in sweet and savory. Ish was very pleasant and accommodating. I had enough time to take in the view while enjoying every dab of the spicy aioli sauce that accompanied the crab cake. \n\nThe crab cake! Bursting with crab!!! Lots of places give you breadcrumbs with some crab sprinkled here and there\u2026Not Industry Kitchen. Had a great time. Will be back."

I can't say a bad word about them except to say there were not enough staff to cover all the tables so it was extremely difficult to get service. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was absolutely atrocious. I booked a table for 10 people. At least 5 of the 10 sent the food back. The \"Chef\" is unskilled and under qualified. We ordered pancakes. An extremely basic dish to make. The pancakes we were served were obviously pre-packaged and microwaved. Foul beyond belief! The eggs were supposed to be over-easy. They were all cooked hard. The potato curls had obviously come out of the freezer and been reheated - awful texture, equally awful flavour, dry and unappetizing. To say that I was extremely disappointed would be a gross understatement. I would certainly not recommend ANYONE to this restaurant. If you want to eat while enjoying the views I would suggest you either buy from any other of the many restaurants in the area or you pack a picnic from home and enjoy that. Do not waste your time and money here."

Some friends and I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday.  When we entered the receptionist checked us in and wished my wife a happy birthday and that was it.  No further recognition. We were seated outside at a table for four.  The noise level, particularly the blaring music made it almost impossible to hear each other.  While waiting for one of our guests to arrive,  two of us ordered iced tea.  A little while later the waiter returned to tell us the iced tea 'machine' was broken.  We ordered a number of small plates.   Three of us tried the mussels  but they literally were inedible.  The waiter was told about it but did nothing.  Among the other plates the ahi tuna nachos were notable for their almost total lack of tuna.  What was included were literally pea size pieces of tuna surrounded by lots of cabbage, avocado, etc.  The crab cake, the margarita pizza and the bianca pizza were just okay but nothing special.  The wines and the tequila cocktail were fine.   But everything was so disappointing that our friends insisted on going elsewhere for dessert  and to celebrate the birthday."

At times it was really good, but other times I found myself frustrated when I had not seen our waiter for about 20 minutes and we just wanted the check. \nBetter spot for a date mid-week when it\u2019s less busy."

However, the day of the actual brunch, the hostess nor the waiter inquired about the celebration.  Why do they ask when you book the reservation, but then when it is the actual day of the meal, no follow-up?"

I have learned that the service staff is always friendly but I do tend to need to ask for things such as water or refills on cocktails. But the staff is always friendly. Caleb was super kind and friendly as well as patient. I enjoyed him. \n\nThe thing that disturbed me this time was seeing the bus boys wearing gloves and touching dirty dishes, then touching my clean water bottle by the opening of the bottle. I have no idea how often the bus boys swap their gloves, but I have a feeling they don\u2019t realize how yucky the gloves are when they are touching clean plates, bottles of water and water glasses. I would prefer to see them not wearing gloves and washing their hands more often. If they were not wearing gloves they would realize how nasty their hands are and I have a feeling would wash their hands more often, in turn keeping the guests plate-ware/ glasses/ silverware more sanitary."

Once the manager finally brought me the check, the server came to grab the book immediately, after not even bothering with my table for the previous 30 mins. Left feeling unseen, last time I came it was much better though? This could be an issue because I dine alone as I\u2019ve had it happen at other places?

My two girlfriends and I ate out on the patio, and then talked and laughed for 4 hours. Without even ordering  coffee or dessert.  Our adorable waiter did not rush us out, kept bringing us fresh water and even moved our umbrella so the setting sun would not get in our eyes.   The food was good and plentiful (although, I do wish there was a turkey burger on the menu!) we were comfortable and the setting just lovely.  But I will NEVER forget the kindness of your staff and that waiter.  Of course, we gave him a tip that was twice the cost of our meal.  Well deserved  !!! Doesn't happen all that much!!\n\nWarmly, Barbara Rosenberg"

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the food is just as terrific as the view. My sundried tomato hummus, kale salad with shrimp and blueberry crumble were all fantastic. My server Sam was an absolute star! He was so friendly and accommodating, and made certain that my dining experience was perfect. All of the other staff members- including the hostesses and the busboys - were just as amazing. I can't wait to go back!"

Our waiter took our order promptly and food delivered quickly, then he disappeared. Asked for dressing on the side of the Caesar salad and it came dressed. Also ordered Bianca pizza, which was delicious. After almost 2 hours we had to ask for our check, which was ok for us because we were enjoying our white sangria and chatting. Overall a good experience and we would return."

We were told nothing was available for us while it was raining and the restaurant was empty. Went on open table and casually got a table. Then took forever for a server to come to the table that clearly didn\u2019t want any tables. We were ready to spend money and hang out for the afternoon but service made us leave. The server didn\u2019t know anything about the menu sent us the wrong food but we just didn\u2019t say anything because it took forever. Any time we wanted another round of drinks it was a problem. I would turn to the host staff to look for help and they would stare at me knowing I needed help and wouldn\u2019t come over. Easily the worst experience I\u2019ve had at any restaurant in Fidi since I\u2019ve lived here."

The service last night was slower than usual bc there were a couple of large parties but the waitstaff was really accommodating about it and apologetic, in a way that made me love the place even more!  This is a regular standby place for me. The food, service, ambience, and water views regularly make it a pleasure to eat here. The food is consistently excellent and fresh."

Would hire this guy in a heartbeat if I had my own restaurant.\n\nThe outdoor dining in the summer is perfect, can\u2019t beat the view and the whole vibe they have going on here.\n\nThe pizza was very good as were the Ahi Nachos. We also had some incredible meatballs and pizza. We didn\u2019t like the steamed mussels them seemed very off and when I mentioned this to the staff they took them back no problem. \n\nHighly recommend this place for a get together with friends. Perfect for large parties and a great place to kick back and hang while enjoying the view."

Skip the desserts: Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and strawberry shortcake were disappointing. Flavorless and drowned in whipped cream from a can. The shortcake was a salty hard biscuit. While the restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautiful, the noise level was very high. It was hard to have a conversation without raising your voice. This may be better when you sit outside. Would eat there again, especially with out of town guests."

The waiter was pleasant and efficient.  The downgraded overall score comes from the disappointment that a birthday was indicated as the occasion for the visit.  However, there was no mention of this by the hostess or waiter and no attention to the occasion with a candle, dessert, etc.  If you ask if there is a special occasion for the reservation, then it should be recognized.  If you can't be bothered to look or notice, then why ask?!"

My husband\u2019s chicken had mushroom in the singular despite what was listed on the menu and I\u2019ve had better seafood pasta from Perkins. When we were asked if we\u2019d be interested in seeing a dessert menu, we responded in the affirmative despite our better judgment. We were presented instead with our check. Perhaps the best recommendation all evening."

The view and heated enclosed house with lights was all amazing. The only thing was that the food got cold fast (because it was cold out) so maybe having the food covered until it is served would be better? Nonetheless, the food tasted great and the overall experience was wonderful. Especially during COVID and wanting to be outside without freezing. I\u2019ll definitely be returning."

            "Review": "Honestly, it was a bad experience but I was going to ignore it but I received my credit card bill today and they tacked on $ to the bill (was it to the tip? Who knows?)  so I\u2019m writing a review a few days later. The server told me the pizzas were personal size so we over ordered, we weren\u2019t super hungry and one pizza could have fed three. We sat in a greenhouse and watched the numerous rats on the esplanade. The server never checked in after our food was delivered and he was slow to bring our check and final bill. The pork belly pizza was horrible tasting. Truly a negative experience overall. And bummer they over charged us."
